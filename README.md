# Final-Year-Project
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting lung cancer using image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system processes CT scan images to identify and classify lung nodules as benign or malignant.
